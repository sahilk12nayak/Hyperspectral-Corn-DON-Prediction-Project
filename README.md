# Hyperspectral-Corn-DON-Prediction-Project
This project contains a machine-learning pipeline for predicting DON (vomitoxin) concentration in corn samples using hyperspectral imaging data.

Installation

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/sahil12nayak/hyperspectral-corn-analysis.git
cd hyperspectral-corn-analysis

Usage

1. Run the complete analysis pipeline:
   python assignment.py
2. Review the generated visualizations in the figures/ directory
3. Read the detailed report in Report.md

Dependencies

Python,
NumPy,
Pandas,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,
Scikit-learn,
TensorFlow


Results

The neural network model achieves an R² score of approximately 0.14 on the test set, demonstrating good predictive performance for DON concentration based on hyperspectral data. The Random Forest benchmark achieves a slightly higher R² of 6.92.
